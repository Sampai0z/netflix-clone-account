# Netflix-clone

For practice, I will try to do a clone of Netflix including the API for the DB which saves all the user information and fav movies and tv shows, etc.

-----------------

- In the folder netflix-account it will be where the user can register or Login in the netflix.
- In the folder netflix-react it will be the main application, where you can whatch and see the movies list etc.
- and at least the api folder where it will be the API.

-----------------

The project was made by my own and all the rights will be for the Founder and owner Netflix! It is just for me to practice my skills and have some projects to my portfolio, if you have any questions just contact me.

If you find any bugs or just want to add something just do a pull and I will check and maybe do a merge. 
Obs. I will only accept new pull's once I finish the project, I will leave the part made of my own just to shown my progress and how it was.


Thanks,
Vitor Sampaio.
